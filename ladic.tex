\section{Towers of $\ell$-adic extensions, $\ell\neq2$}

Let $p$ be a prime number, we are interested in the tower of extensions of
$k=\mathbb{F}_p$ of degree $\ell^i$, where $\ell\notin\left\{ 2, p
\right\}$ is an other prime
number and $i\in\mathbb{N}$ is an integer. For each $i$, we denote by
$K_i=\mathbb{F}_{p^{\ell^i}}$ the extension of degree $\ell^i$, $\zeta_i$ a
$\ell^i$-th primitive root of unity and $r_i$ the integer such that
$k(\zeta_i)\cong\mathbb{F}_{p^{r_i}}$. We also denote by $A_i=K_i\otimes
k(\zeta_i)$ the algebra used to solve Hilbert 90 problems, and $\alpha_i\in A_i$ the
solution that we use.

We have $r_1=\omega_{(\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z})^\times}(p)$, where
$\omega_{(\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z})^\times}(p)$ denotes the order of $p$ in
$(\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z})^\times$. If we denote by $\upsilon=v_\ell(p^{r_1}-1)$
the $\ell$-adic valuation of $p^{r_1}-1$, we get 
\[
  r_1 = r_2 = \cdots = r_{\upsilon},
\]
and if $i\geq\upsilon$, we have $r_{i+1}=\ell r_i$.

Assume we have an integer $n\in\mathbb{N}$, a root
$\zeta_n$ and a solution of Hilbert 90 $\alpha_n\in A_n$. We are interested in
constructing the embedding $K_n\emb K_{n+1}$, using Allombert's algorithm. We
first compute 
\[
  g = \gcd(\pi_n(x^\ell), \Phi_{\ell^{n+1}}(x)),
\]
where $\pi_n$ is the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_n$ over $k$ and
$\Phi_{\ell^{n+1}}$ is the $\ell^{n+1}$-th cyclotomic polynomial. We set
$\pi_{n+1}$ to be an irreducicle factor of $g$ and we take $\zeta_{n+1}$ a root
of $\pi_{n+1}$. We then define $A_{n+1}=K_{n+1}\otimes k(\zeta_{n+1})$ and
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
  N: & K_{n+1}\otimes k(\zeta_{n+1}) & \to & K_{n+1}\otimes k(\zeta_n) \\
  & x\otimes y & \mapsto & \prod_{j=0}^{\ell-1} x \otimes \sigma^{jr_n}(y)
\end{array}
\]
where $\sigma$ is the Frobenius automorphism of $k$. In other words, given
$\gamma=x\otimes y\in A_{n+1}$, if $r_{n+1}=r_n$, we have $N(\gamma) =
\gamma^\ell$, and if $r_{n+1}=\ell r_n$, we have $N(\gamma) = x^\ell\otimes
N_{k(\zeta_{n+1})/k(\zeta_n)}(y)$, where $N_{k(\zeta_{n+1})/k(\zeta_n)}$ is the
norm of $k(\zeta_{n+1})$ over $k(\zeta_n)$. 

We embed $k(\zeta_n)$ in $k(\zeta_{n+1})$ by sending $\zeta_n$ to
$\zeta_{n+1}^\ell$. With that choice we have that
\[
  N(1\otimes\zeta_{n+1})=1\otimes\zeta_n.
\]
We also see that $N$ and $\sigma\otimes1$ commute, and for any $\alpha,
\beta\in A_{n+1}$, we have that \[
  N(\alpha\beta) = N(\alpha)N(\beta).
\]
So if $\beta\in A_{n+1}$ is a nonzero solution of the Hilbert 90 problem in $A_{n+1}$ for
$1\otimes\zeta_{n+1}$, \ie
\[
  (\sigma\otimes 1)(\beta) = (1\otimes\zeta_{n+1})\beta,
\]
then $N(\beta)$ is a nonzero solution of Hilbert 90 for $1\otimes\zeta_n$:
\begin{align*}
  (\sigma\otimes1)(N(\beta)) &= N((\sigma\otimes1)(\beta)) \\
  &= N(1\otimes\zeta_{n+1})N(\beta) \\
  &= (1\otimes\zeta_n)N(\beta).
\end{align*}
This also implies that $N(\beta)$ is in fact in $A_n$, so we have that
\[
  N(\beta) = (1\otimes a)\alpha_n,
\]
with $1\otimes a\in 1\otimes k(\zeta_n)$ and $a\neq0$, because the solutions of Hilbert 90 in $A_n$
form a $k(\zeta_n)$ vector space of dimension $1$. We now want to find an
element $1\otimes b\in1\otimes k(\zeta_{n+1})$ such that $N(1\otimes b)=1\otimes a^{-1}$. We distinguish two
cases: $r_{n+1}=\ell r_n$ and $r_{n+1}=r_n$.

Let us first assume that $r_{n+1}=\ell r_n$, it means that $k(\zeta_n)\subsetneq
k(\zeta_{n+1})$ and that $N$ operates as the norm
$N_{k(\zeta_{n+1})/k(\zeta_n)}$ on the right side of $A_{n+1}$. Since this norm
is surjective we can find the  element $b$ such that $N(1\otimes b)=1\otimes a^{-1}$ and
we set $\alpha_{n+1}= (1\otimes b)\beta$, in order to have
$N(\alpha_{n+1})=\alpha_n$. In order to compute $b$ we remark that either
$a^{-1}$ is a $\ell$-th power in $k(\zeta_n)$, or the polynomial
$X^\ell-a^{-1}$ is irreducible in $k(\zeta_n)[X]$, so computing an $\ell$-th
root of $a^{-1}$ is sufficient.

In the case where $r_{n+1}=r_n$, there is only one of the $\ell$ possible roots
$\zeta_{n+1}$ such that $a$ is a $\ell$-th power, at least for $\ell\neq2$.
