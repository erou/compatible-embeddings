# Compatible embeddings

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/erou/compatible-embeddings/master)

Some writing about lattices of compatibly embedded finite fields and their implementation using Nemo/Flint.

## Binder

A proof of concept of compatible finite fields using Allombert's algorithm and
[Sagemath](http://www.sagemath.org/) is
available in the Jupyter notenook `embed.ipynb`. It is possible to play with
it with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), by clicking on the binder badge : [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/erou/compatible-embeddings/master)
